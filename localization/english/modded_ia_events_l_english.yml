The city lays on a trade route to Craglorn and lays on artificial hill surrounded from all sides by mountains. "

He even found the perfect location on one of the islands in the Niben Bay."

 alessian_revolt_mission_1.19.desc:0 "The Ayleid kings of Colovia contrary to their heartlander counterparts were primarily merchants and didn't participated in the cruel practices of their kinsmen. Many of them kept the faith in Auri-El and their subjects remaind loyal to them. Thats why some Colovians within our ranks proposed to allow them to surrender piecefully and join our cause to atone for the sins of their race."

 alessian_revolt_mission_1.21.desc:0 "Eplear Camoran's unification of the Bosmer marks the beginig of time in calendars of most nations on Tamriel. This is no small achivement. Camorans are the first to unite their race under one state. Since the first year of the first age all bosmer live and die under their rule. This forced even the anti-elven nedic rebels to try the diplomacy to deal with border issue. Camorans are known from non-violent approach when dealing with foreign ambasadors so maybe then whole thing will end peacefully."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.21.a:0 "Let's hope so."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.22.t:0 "Delegation from the North"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.22.desc:0 "A group of diplomats arrived from the north. These must be the nedic rebels we heard so much about. They recieved an escort at the border and were treated with respect as I decreed. They arrived to resolve the matter of border between our countries. Their proposition is that the area of their new state should be to the north of the river Strid. This sounds reasonable since this is the old border with the Ayleid Empire for before the war."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.22.a:0 "Tell them we are taking the deal."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.22.b:0 "They commited attrocities on our ayleid bretheren so we cannot trust them."

 alessian_revolt_mission_1.23.desc:0 "Al-Esh, more commonly known as Alessia, is the leader of our movement. Lately she was captured by the enemy who didn't knew her true importance. She needs to be rescued from captivity before the elven opressors manage to break her."

 alessian_revolt_mission_1.26.t:0 "Camorans accept the terms"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.26.desc:0 "King of Valenwood accepted the border and trade treaties. The warm welcome surprised us but our guides explained that bosmer had no more love for daedrophile Ayleids than us and the conditional surrender offered to some colovian elves helped to sway their opinion."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.26.a:0 "The pen was stronger than sword."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.27.t:0 "Camorans rejected the terms"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.27.desc:0 "Valenwood rejected the terms of the treaty. We were treated surprisingly well thou the meat offered on a feast had weird taste and one of the servants went missing. We hope that despite this setback we will manage buid good relations in the future. Valenwood is powerfull kingdom and war could be disastrous for both states."

 alessian_revolt_mission_1.30.t:0 "Uniting the Tribes"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.30.desc:0 "Thou our group is the biggest in the empire we are not the only one. There are numerous nedic tribes in ayleid realm that achived independence in this chaotic times. Alessia believes that the best course of action is to convince them that only together we can chase the daedra worshippers out of Cyrodiil."

Their leader, Alessia want to build a coalition against the Ayleid opressors and want us to participate in it. She claims to be a dragonborn and intends to unite Cyrodiil after the war so we never be slaves again. The question is can she be trusted?"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.31.a:0 "We cannot fight alone."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.31.b:0 "We will fight but under our own banner."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.31.c:0 "Dragonborn? She thinks we are fools?"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.32.t:0 "Capture of White-Gold Tower"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.32.desc:0 "For centuries White-Gold Tower was a symbol of Ayleid power and domination over men. Today we managed to capture the city but the nedic rebels demand the retribution for all the crimes the elves commited while our elven supporters beg for restraint and protection for their most holy site. This on the other hand may anger the soldiers that expect plunder for their service."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.32.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.32.b:0 "We must be better than elves!"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.29.t:0 "House Tharn Defection"

Their last client was king of Fanacas. Now one of them contacted us and want to be pardoned for his crimes in exchange for his families wealth and contacts in the Ayleid Empire. This may really hurt the elves, but can they be trusted after all they have done."

 alessian_revolt_mission_1.98.t:0 "Cyrodiilic Empire"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.98.desc:0 "For the first time since the Ayleids first spet foot on the lands of Cyrodiil the nedes are truly free from elven influence. From Jerall Mountains to Topal Bay almost all elven strongholds surrendered to our rule."

 alessian_revolt_mission_1.99.t:0 "Fall of the Ayleids"
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.99.desc:0 "For centuries the Ayleid Empire dominated the heart of Tamriel. Now the news from Cyrodiil say that civil war have ended and now man rule over Cyrodiil. The province is united as never before and instead of elven kings have now only nedic one. This is good news for humans that still live under human rule in other regions of Tamriel but the time will tell if the cyrodiilic nedes will not turn from victims to opressors with the empire they have created."
 alessian_revolt_mission_1.99.a:0 "We will see."
