 esfa_startup.1.t:0 "The Sommerset Isles"
 esfa_startup.1.desc:0 "The Summerset Isles are the best lands in Tamriel after Cyrodiil. And coupled with the fact that, as the name suggests, an archipelago of islands, they are relatively easy to defend. It was the first London to be reached by elven ships before the elves spread throughout the rest of the continent. \nHowever, mastering the islands was not easy. To control Alinor, it was necessary, among others Defeat the Sloads with the magically gifted race of slug-like necromancers and other dangerous creatures. Since many of them did not survive to later times, it is assumed that Aldmer did not take prisoners, to put it lightly, at times. \nThe last obstacle to complete control of the islands were the goblins who fled into the mountains and even founded a small kingdom around King's Haven Pass in the north. The lack of larger opponents meant that the altmers also began to fight among themselves, after all, who would not like to rule such valuable lands."

 esfa_startup.3.desc:0 "Valenwood has been home to the Wood Elves for many centuries. However, they were not the first inhabitants in these parts. The Imga, a people of friendly ape-like creatures called Imga, has lived in harmony with the elves for a long time, harboring admiration for them and imitating their behavior. In the eastern part of the province, there are forest orcs living in their strongholds. \nRecently, King Eplear united the forest into one country. In theory, he controls the entire area of Valenwood, but the Orcs and some Bosmer clans do not recognize him as their ruler. Nevertheless, it is an epochal achievement and the date of the announcement of the creation of the new state is considered to be the year zero for Tamriel."
