 esfa_startup.1.t:0 "The Sommerset Isles"
 esfa_startup.1.desc:0 "The Summerset Isles are the most profitable lands in Tamriel right after Cyrodiil. And coupled with the fact that, as the name suggests, it is an archipelago of islands, they are relatively easy to defend. It was the first land to be reached by elven ships before the elves spread throughout the rest of the continent. \nHowever, mastering the islands was not easy. To control Alinor, it was necessary, among others Defeat the Sloads which are a magically gifted race of slug-like necromancers and other dangerous creatures. Since many of them did not survive to later times, it is assumed that Aldmer did not took prisoners. \nThe last obstacle to complete control of the islands were the goblins who fled into the mountains and even founded a small kingdom around King's Haven Pass in the north. The lack of larger opponents meant that the altmers also began to fight among themselves, after all, who would not like to rule such valuable lands."
 esfa_startup.1.a:0 "Homeland worth dying for!"
 esfa_startup.2.t:0 "Green Manace"
 esfa_startup.2.desc:0 "The goblins are creatures of small stature and annoying attitude what combined with their rather ugly appearence makes them perfect scapegoats and outcasts. They can be found in every corner of Tamriel usually far from civilised areas like Deathlands (Hammerfell) or abecean isles. There is even remote kingdom of goblins in the mountains of Eton-Nir. They seem to believe in deadra but to this day only worship of Malacath and Hircine was confirmed."
 esfa_startup.2.a:0 "Will they find safety from prosecution?"
 esfa_startup.3.t:0 "Valenwood"
 esfa_startup.3.desc:0 "Valenwood has been home to the Wood Elves for many centuries. However, they were not the first inhabitants in these parts. The Imga, a people of friendly ape-like creatures, has lived in harmony with the elves for a long time, harboring admiration for them and imitating their behavior. In the eastern part of the province, there are forest orcs living in their strongholds. \nRecently, King Eplear united the forest into one country. In theory, he controls the entire area of Valenwood, but the Orcish and Imga clans do not recognize him as their ruler. Nevertheless, it is an epochal achievement and the date of the announcement of the creation of the new state is considered to be the year zero for Tamriel."
 esfa_startup.3.a:0 "But can Eplear hold realm together?"
 esfa_startup.4.t:0 "Aylied Empire"
 esfa_startup.4.desc:0 "With the rise of Valenwood the Ayleid Empire was cut off from the domination of Sommerset. Almost immediately the issues started rising. First the Celemaril Light-Bringers revolt, then the Delodiil-Abagarlas conflict caused by deadric cults in both cities. The Aylied kings knew that the strong leader was needed to end the religious conflicts so as the result the empire devided between the Besarabic League of traditionalist elves believing that deadric worship must be abolished the Deadric worshipers fighting them but also themselves and the Colovian warlords staying as far form the conflict as possible."
 esfa_startup.4.a:0 "Who will unite the Empire again?"
 esfa_startup.5.t:0 "Horned Warriors"
 esfa_startup.5.desc:0 "The minotaurs have a very direct connection with the nature (and godess Kyne) and the recent elven heretical activities (like using human souls as batteries for mages and machines of war) forced them to take more active role in the politics of Tamriel. They might not be numerous like humans or elves but they are capable fighters and their natural magic resistance is usually too much for the less capable oponents."
 esfa_startup.5.a:0 "Glory to the godess of nature!"
 esfa_startup.6.t:0 "Cats of the South"
 esfa_startup.6.desc:0 "Khajiits are cat-like humanoids that comes in many shapes and sizes from small kitten to the large jaguar like beasts that can be ridden(thou it is not advised). They live in a conphederacy consisting of 16 tribal states. Because of the hills and deserts deviding the province from the other parts of continent they have no other enemies around. Some clans still live near Niben Bay but most of them left to avoid enslavement by the elves."
 esfa_startup.6.a:0 "Can peace last?"
 esfa_startup.7.t:0 "Humans of Tamriel"
 esfa_startup.7.desc:0 "Nedes are rumored to come from Atmora but there are little evidence for this. Other scholars suggest them being native to Tamriel but probably we will never know for sure. They live in almost every region from High Rock to Black Marsh usually being enslaved by the elves. The mostly advanced nedic group lives in Hammerfell benefiting from the trade with the Dwemer from Markarth unintrested in their scorched land. The instability in the Ayleid empire gives them opportunity for freeing themselves from elven domination."
 esfa_startup.7.a:0 "Will they find stability?"
 esfa_startup.8.t:0 "Orcish Clans"
 esfa_startup.8.desc:0 "Orcs live in a pack like clan structure with only the chief having the breeding rites. They follow doctrine known as the Code of Malacath. Their religion requires them to be in top phisiccal shape so the old orcs are frequently seen looking for so called 'good death' in combat. The clans usually stay away from the larger politics. All orcs dream about finding a home for their race where they could live without fear of prosecution from the other races."
 esfa_startup.8.a:0 "The dream of Orsinium."
 esfa_startup.9.t:0 "Lizards of Argonia"
 esfa_startup.9.desc:0 "Argonians are reptile like humanoids living between Argonia, Morrowind and Blackwood in southern Cyrodiil. They have natural resistance to deseases and poisons since Argonian interior is highly toxic and dangerous place. They posess strong bond with the Hist. The santient trees in return for protection give argonians various benefits. They are rumored to have ability to change entire races phisical parameters for example making them stronger or faster. The argonians suffer from chimer slave raids and ayleids also founded couple colonies. There are also Nedic human tribes and Lilmolith fox race native to southern Black Marsh."
 esfa_startup.9.a:0 "Will Hists grant them aid?"
 esfa_startup.10.t:0 "Graet Apes"
 esfa_startup.10.desc:0 "Imga are pacifist race. They tend to avoid conflict if possible. They have tendency to mimic the elven behaviours. Even they distastes for humans. This habit goes as far as painting the fur color to look more like the elves or having meaningles titles. Surprisingly there never were any news about prosecutions of Imgas."
 esfa_startup.10.a:0 "Maybe the power of simping really works?"
 esfa_startup.11.t:0 "Sons of Atmora"
 esfa_startup.11.desc:0 "Nords in Tamriel:\n Nords started their migration into Tamriel forced by the climate change that started to change Atmora into a snowball. When they arrived in Tamriel they encountered the Falmer. Elves initially welcomed the nordic settlers with open arms and no one expected the tragedy. From small group of survivors we know that from unknown reson falmer army attacked the settlement of Saarthal and using element of surprise sloughtered the inhabitants. One of the survivors dragon priest Ysgramor led campaign of revenge against the elves and drived them into extinction. Afterwards the heirs of the victorious leader led Nords for 13 generations. House of Ysgramor survived the revolt against dragons and countless other tragedies. Now High King died before his son was born. Some doubt in him being legitimate and this creates issues. Can Skyrim survive also this crisis? \n Nords in Solstheim:\n Much like in other parts of Tamriel in Solstheim nordic warriors manage to defeat the elves led by the Snow Prince. Afterwards dragon priest Miraak led the revolt against other dragon priests which he lost and then disappeared. This led to weakening of the dragoncult hold over the isle and eventually to birth of a new faith the All-Maker cult. The followers of All-Maker believe in one god under many aspects instead of traditional Nordic Pantheon. For ages the Solstheim Nords lived in harmony with nature and with blessing of their diety. Will they manage to convince their kinsmen to a new way?\n Nords of Roscrea:\n Nords of Roscea are entirely separate group from those that migrated to Skyrim. Yet even here the dreadfull dragon cult ruled with iron fist. Roscreans managed to revolt against the dragons under the leadership of bear cult. Afterwards the victorious cults devided the isle between themselves and period of constant civil war followed. Will Roscreans ever be united?"
 esfa_startup.11.a:0 "May the voice guide them."
 esfa_startup.12.t:0 "Man-Meri"
 esfa_startup.12.desc:0 "The Bretons are the ofspring of the man and mer. Most of them live in High Rock where the law allowed on such unions. Actually the habit of having human concubines were especially popular among the Dirreni clan. Today the newest race live in elven kingdoms of Iliac Bay as a middle clas between elves and nedes. As their numbers grow they get more and autonomy from their elven overlords even geting landed titles."
 esfa_startup.12.a:0 "They surely can get far."
 esfa_startup.13.t:0 "Defenders of Adda-Mantia"
 esfa_startup.13.desc:0 "Members of the Direnni clan take great pride in their achievements. They owe their wealth to their ancestors who were the best alchemists in Sommerset. At some point, part of the clan decided to leave the islands and head west. Few know that it was not Topal who first discovered Tamriel, but the Direnni who landed on the island of Balfiera and, due to the presence of Ada-Mantia, decided to make it their home. When it came to the first contacts with people, unlike other elves, they saw the advantages of peaceful cooperation and, despite the ban on taking the highest positions, they lived much better under the rule of Direnni than in other elven countries of that period. However, not everyone likes the new force in the gulf. The Druids of High Rock continue to cause trouble, and new human kingdoms have arisen in Hamerfell. There are also rumors of a new race of northerners who want to rid Tamriel of the elves."
 esfa_startup.13.a:0 "Defenders of Ada-Mantia!"
 esfa_startup.14.t:0 "Children of Auri-El"
 esfa_startup.14.desc:0 "The Snow Elves posessed large and prosperous kingdom in northern Tamriel. Their culture in their prime was said to rival Alinor. But all of it was destroyed by a simple misunderstanding. When Nords founded the colony of Saarthal the Falmer accepted them with open armes and pieceful relations followed. Then one day the humans found artifact they were not able to control and in the ensuing chaos elves thought that they were attacked. Human colony was razed to the ground and the following war brought the Snow Elves to the brink of extinction. Only a couple settlements remain and now the decision must be made on how to ensure the survival of the species."
 esfa_startup.14.a:0 "Falmer lives matter!"
 esfa_startup.15.t:0 "The Deep Elves"
 esfa_startup.15.desc:0 "Dwemer are the gray skinned breed of elves living under the Tamriels surface. They do not worship dieties or ancestors as other races which is often the reason for distrusd and superstitions that outsiders feel about them. Insted the Dwemer deify the universe or Nirni as a whole and believe that sience and understanding is the best way to worship the earth that gave them life. Dwarves were twice unified under one rule but for the most time they live in city-states with the exception of Vvardenfell. Lately dwarven scientist Kagrenak discovered something extrordinary under the Dwemer fortress on Red Mountain. The Heart of a dead god Lorkhan. Now the new artifactgave them great oportunity but messing with the devine powers is a risky endavor. "
 esfa_startup.15.a:0 "What the future will bring?"
 esfa_startup.16.t:0 "Elves of the East"
 esfa_startup.16.desc:0 "The Chimer are the youngest of the mer races but for such a short time that their culture exist they managed to achieve enaugh to make even altmer jelous. Following prophet Veloth the children of Azurah crossed the Valus Mountains escaping religious prosecutions and ended up in Resdayn(Morrowind) and thou the land was not very hospitsble they initially had little oposition and managed to push back the scattered argonian tribes they encountered in central and southern part of the country. The real trouble began when in the north and especially on Vvardenfell they encountered the Dwemer. The two cultures thou elven were dirastically different and the conflict was inevitable. Then the real tragedy happened when the Chimer heartlands were attacked by the Nedic conphederacy under the leadership of Rontha tribe. Yet the Chimer didn't get this far to give up now. Their daedric gods tought them that life is not a curse but a test that we all must pass."
 esfa_startup.16.a:0 "For Azura and saint Veloth!"
 esfa_startup.17.t:0 "Foxes of Argonia"
 esfa_startup.17.desc:0 "The foxmen arrived in argonia somewhere near the end of the Merethic era most likely escaping from some calamity in Akavir. Noone knows what exacly happened because the fox-folk themselves destroyed every record of the event to prevent the next generations from returning to their formr home. Now they founded two colonies in Argonian region of Murkmire and thou there are not many of them they do not have other way but to fight for their right to these lands."
 esfa_startup.17.a:0 "Hope they will find new home in Tamriel."
 esfa_startup.18.t:0 "Slugs of Thras"
 esfa_startup.18.desc:0 "Sloads are deffinately one of the most unique races most Tamrielians had to face. They spend their youth in the sea and switch to life on land when reaching maturity. The characteristic that mostly distinguishes them from other races is (not including their look) complete lack of moral standards. It's not that their evil, thats just how they minds work. Sload can mimic emotions for the sake of the person he contacts with but do not experiences them the same way other races do. They can lie, kill, murder in orger to achieve their goal. Because of their bodies sloads use reanimated corpses in combat. They do not worship any gods but are known to make pacts with daedric princes if they see benefit for themselves. In the past Sload realms covered most of the Alinors coasts but high elves chased them away. The Sload sociery is based on strength and cunningness. The best slug rules."
 esfa_startup.18.a:0 "And one day Alinor will be Sload breeding ground once again!"
 esfa_startup.19.t:0 "Sea Dragons"
 esfa_startup.19.desc:0 "Acording to the records kept in the Crystal Tower Orgnum, the god-king of the Sea Elves, was extremely wealthy immortal merish wizard living in Aldmeris before unknown cataclysm forced aldmer to migrate to Alinor. Orgnum himself never speaks about that times but from surviving informations he and his followers attempted a coup which failed and as punishment they were banished from Aldmeris to tropical land of Pyandonea. There separated by the magical barrirer made from myst they created their unique culture and lived in relative peace until unexpected news reached them. Their long lost cusins lost their home and moved to Alinor. Orgnum was furious when he heard the news and refused to live his chambers for couple days. When he finally left them his mood changed. He declared himself the living incarnation of god Satakal and true leader of all mer races. Then he sworn oath to dedicate his immortal life to conquer the Sommerset Isles. "
 esfa_startup.19.a:0 "Death to the Altmer!"
 esfa_startup.20.t:0 "Death Worshippers"
 esfa_startup.20.desc:0 "Nissawi are a group of tribes that in order to keep their way of life and faith in Sithis decided to move to Pyandonea. They feared the Hists and false immortality the santient trees were promising and in order to avoid the temptations cut their ties to the rest of Saxhleel. They believed that in their new land far away from enemies they will be safe. Yet, one day strange ships arrived carrying elven refugees on board. New enemies were powerfull. They wielded strange magic, they were able to tame the sacred serpents. It seems almost that tribes will have to find new home ones again. But argonian spirit is strong, and Sithis always demands new sacrifices. "
 esfa_startup.20.a:0 "Blessed be the master of the Void!"
 esfa_startup.21.t:0 "Warriors of Yokuda"
 esfa_startup.21.desc:0 "Humans of Yokuda are a dark-skinned race proud from their military achivements. Not that long ago they managed to successfully revolt against the elven race called today as Sinismer. From their former masters they inherited empire three times the size of Tamriel and started moving east to find and destroy last holdouts of Sinismer left on the islands between Tamriel and Yokuda. Thou Ra-Gada like all humans are able to use magic they only do so when it is necessary. They believe that using magic is a sign of weekness and magic users are often rejected by community(thou there are rare exceptions in some subcultures). This belief might have been caused by the elves from yokuda that were known from their magical abilities. Ra-Gada or in Tamrielic redguards are known from use of sword-singing which is basically art of summoning swords (or other wepons, swords are just favored by redguard) using their spiritual energy. The Empire is great and powerfull, it seems that only Ra-Gada themselves can stop their ascension."
 esfa_startup.21.a:0 "May Leki aid us in battle!"
 esfa_startup.22.t:0 "Elves of the West"
 esfa_startup.22.desc:0 "Not long ago Sinismer were beaten by the human revolt in Yokuda and were forced to flee east towards Kasaz and Yelir Archipelagos. In the past weilding the power of stone magic they were able to create the largest empire Nirn ever seen. But Yokudans turned out to be worthy opponents. With their sword-singers able to create powerfull wepons out of their spiritual energy they managed to successfully revolt and chase them out of continenet. Now scattered elven clans must rebuild in the goblin infested isles and unite to defeat their persuers."
 esfa_startup.22.a:0 "We will have our revenge!"
 esfa_startup.23.t:0 "Snake-Men of Akavir"
 esfa_startup.23.desc:0 "The portraying of the Tsaesci as a snake-man is a common misconseption that probably comes from the snakes being very important in their culture to the point of them being carved or painted on nearly every item of building from Akavir. Also tsaesci nobility have very long lifespans for a human race. The tsaesci elders say that in the past when their ancestors defeated mighty dragons they absorbed their power using dark rituals which gave them prolonged lifespans. The tsaesci armies and navies are known as the best in the east. They are able to carry out the slave raids as far as Skyrim in Tamriel. Thou now the snake-folk is devided among many kingdoms if united they have resources to conquer the continent."
 esfa_startup.23.a:0 "Long live the Akavir!"
 esfa_startup.24.t:0 "Bat-Man of Yneslea"
 esfa_startup.24.desc:0 "The bat-folk of Yneslea developed their civilisation largely thanks to the neoghbouring colony of clan Noraken. The Dwemer using the tonal architecture changed the echmer appearence to be more humanoid and contrary to their customs tought the young race almost everything they knew. The more oriental influences in architecture are largely thanks to the Akaviri invasions. The inhabitants of the eastern continent attacked the Yneslea mainly to gain access to southern Tamriel and only because of the echmer resistance Akavir managed to attack Tamriel only a couple of times and never successfully. The home of the echmer is another story in itself. The isles were in the past part of one subcontinent but due to ancient cataclysm we now have only two larger ones Yne and Slea and several smaller. Almost all visitors describe the isles as a tropical paradise on earth."
 esfa_startup.24.a:0 "The paradise indeed."
 esfa_startup.25.t:0 "House of Quey"
 esfa_startup.25.desc:0 "Thou the followers of prophet Veloth are probably the most well known and the biggest daedric cult not all chimer worship the Azura, Mephala and Boethiah. Shortly after reaching the Morrowind many elves felt disapointed with their new home. Yes they were safe from prosecution but the land itself was not particularly fertile, the locals were extremely hostile and the supposed godesses not particularly helpful. Leaders of one of the houses decided that if the Azura didn't fulfilled her obligations then they will simply not fulfill theirs and they started to pray to elven gods for forgiveness. One day they saw vulcanic eruption form isle in the east while the sun was rising and recognized this as a sign from Magnus and left for their new home and from the name of the house to this day the isles are called Cathnoquey Archipelago. Some time afterwards also human kothringi appeared on the westen isles but the two groups managed to coexist with eachother till now."
 esfa_startup.25.a:0 "May Magnus guide us!"
