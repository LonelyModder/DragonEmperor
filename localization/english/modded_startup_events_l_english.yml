 #Startup Event Texts
 esfa_startup.1.t:0 "The Sommerset Isles"
 esfa_startup.1.desc:0 "The Summerset Isles are the most profitable lands in Tamriel right after Cyrodiil. And coupled with the fact that, as the name suggests, it is an archipelago of islands, they are relatively easy to defend. It was the first land to be reached by elven ships before the elves spread throughout the rest of the continent. \nHowever, mastering the islands was not easy. To control Alinor, it was necessary, among others Defeat the Sloads which are a magically gifted race of slug-like necromancers and other dangerous creatures. Since many of them did not survive to later times, it is assumed that Aldmer did not took prisoners. \nThe last obstacle to complete control of the islands were the goblins who fled into the mountains and even founded a small kingdom around King's Haven Pass in the north. The lack of larger opponents meant that the altmers also began to fight among themselves, after all, who would not like to rule such valuable lands."
 esfa_startup.1.a:0 "Homeland worth dying for!"
 esfa_startup.2.t:0 "Green Manace"
 esfa_startup.2.desc:0 "The goblins are creatures of small stature and annoying attitude what combined with their rather ugly appearence makes them perfect scapegoats and outcasts. They can be found in every corner of Tamriel usually far from civilised areas like Deathlands (Hammerfell) or abecean isles. There is even remote kingdom of goblins in the mountains of Eton-Nir. They seem to believe in deadra but to this day only worship of Malacath and Hircine was confirmed."
 esfa_startup.2.a:0 "Will they find safety from prosecution?"
 esfa_startup.3.t:0 "Valenwood"
 esfa_startup.3.desc:0 "Valenwood has been home to the Wood Elves for many centuries. However, they were not the first inhabitants in these parts. The Imga, a people of friendly ape-like creatures, has lived in harmony with the elves for a long time, harboring admiration for them and imitating their behavior. In the eastern part of the province, there are forest orcs living in their strongholds. \nRecently, King Eplear united the forest into one country. In theory, he controls the entire area of Valenwood, but the Orcish and Imga clans do not recognize him as their ruler. Nevertheless, it is an epochal achievement and the date of the announcement of the creation of the new state is considered to be the year zero for Tamriel."
 esfa_startup.3.a:0 "But can Eplear hold realm together?"
 esfa_startup.4.t:0 "Aylied Empire"
 esfa_startup.4.desc:0 "With the rise of Valenwood the Ayleid Empire was cut off from the domination of Sommerset. Almost immediately the issues started rising. First the Celemaril Light-Bringers revolt, then the Delodiil-Abagarlas conflict caused by deadric cults in both cities. The Aylied kings knew that the strong leader was needed to end the religious conflicts so as the result the empire devided between the Besarabic League of traditionalist elves believing that deadric worship must be abolished the Deadric worshipers fighting them but also themselves and the Colovian warlords staying as far form the conflict as possible."
 esfa_startup.4.a:0 "Who will unite the Empire again?"
 esfa_startup.5.t:0 "Horned Warriors"
 esfa_startup.5.desc:0 "The minotaurs have a very direct connection with the nature (and godess Kyne) and the recent elven heretical activities (like using human souls as batteries for mages and machines of war) forced them to take more active role in the politics of Tamriel. They might not be numerous like humans or elves but they are capable fighters and their natural magic resistance is usually too much for the less capable oponents."
 esfa_startup.5.a:0 "Glory to the godess of nature!"
 esfa_startup.6.t:0 "Cats of the South"
 esfa_startup.6.desc:0 "Khajiits are cat-like creatures that comes in many shapes and sizes from small kitten to the large jaguar like beasts that can be ridden(thou it is not advised). They are united in conphederacy of sixteen kingdoms that seem to live in harmony with one another. Because of the hills and deserts deviding the province from the other parts of continent they have no other enemies around. Some clans still live near Niben Bay but most of them left to avoid enslavement by the elves."
 esfa_startup.6.a:0 "Can peace last?"
 esfa_startup.7.t:0 "Humans of Tamriel"
 esfa_startup.7.desc:0 "Nedes are rumored to come from Atmora but there are little evidence for this. Other scholars suggest them being native to Tamriel but probably we will never know for sure. They live in almost every region from High Rock to Black Marsh usually being enslaved by the elves. The mostly advanced nedic group lives in Hammerfell benefiting from the trade with the Dwemer from Markarth unintrested in their scorched land. The instability in the Ayleid empire gives them opportunity for freeing themselves from elven domination."
 esfa_startup.7.a:0 "Will they find stability?"
 esfa_startup.8.t:0 "Orcish Clans"
 esfa_startup.8.desc:0 "Orcs live in a pack like clan structure with only the chief having the breeding rites. They follow doctrine known as the Code of Malacath. Their religion requires them to be in top phisiccal shape so the old orcs are frequently seen looking for so called 'good death' in combat. The clans usually stay away from the larger politics. All orcs dream about finding a home for their race where they could live without fear of prosecution from the other races."
 esfa_startup.8.a:0 "The dream of Orsinium."
 esfa_startup.9.t:0 "Lizards of Argonia"
 esfa_startup.9.desc:0 "Argonians are reptile like humanoids living between Argonia, Morrowind and Blackwood in Cyrodiil. They have natural resistance to deseases and poisons since Argonian interior is uninhabitable for other races. They have natural bond with the Hist. The santient trees in return for protection give argonians various benefits. They are rumored to have ability to change entire races phisical parameters for example making them stronger. The argonians suffer from chimer slave raids and ayleids also founded couple colonies. There are also Nedic human tribes and Lilmolith fox race native to southern Black Marsh."
 esfa_startup.9.a:0 "Will Hists grant them aid?"
 esfa_startup.10.t:0 "Graet Apes"
 esfa_startup.10.desc:0 "Imga are pacifist race. They tend to avoid conflict if possible. They have tendency to mimic the elven behaviours. Even they distastes for humans. This habit goes as far as painting the fur color to look more like the elves or having meaningles titles. Surprisingly there never were any news about prosecutions of Imgas."
 esfa_startup.10.a:0 "Maybe the power of simping really works?"
 esfa_startup.11.t:0 "Sons of Kyne"
 esfa_startup.11.desc:0 "The Nords came very recently to Tamriel. Their migration was caused by the changing climate of their homeland of Atmora. Initially they were welcomed with open arms but after the unfortunate events of the 'Night of Tears' when elves sloughtered almost entire population of Saarthal colony they began relentless attacks against elves in Skyrim their new mountaineous homeland. Later on they rebelled against dragons and their priests that ruled over them with iron fists and elevated their own kings from the line of Ysgramor who led the revenge campaign against elves. Lately because of premature death of their king and infancy of his heir the country engulfed civil war and some left the Skyrim for Cyrodiil to avoid fighting their kinsmen. Also not all elven holdouts and dragon cult keeps in Skyrim were destroyed so the new regime will have a lot of tasks ahead of them."
 esfa_startup.11.a:0 "For Shor and skyrim!"
 esfa_startup.12.t:0 "Man-Meri"
 esfa_startup.12.desc:0 "The Bretons are the ofspring of the man and mer. Most of them live in High Rock where the law allowed on such unions. Actually the habit of having human concubines were especially popular among the Dirreni clan. Today the newest race live in elven kingdoms of Iliac Bay as a middle clas between elves and nedes. As their numbers grow they get more and autonomy from their elven overlords even geting landed titles."
 esfa_startup.12.a:0 "They surely can get far."
