 form_orsinium:0 "Form the Kingdom of Orsinium"
 form_orsinium_desc:0 "Orsinium was a great dream of the greenskin races of Tamriel.

 form_hkvalen:0 "Form the Kingdom of Valenwood"
 form_hkvalen_desc:0 "Conquering the numerous bosmer clans and forcing the tribunal of basically living gods to cooperation was a feat that made from the unification of Valenwood by the Eplear Camoran the event that marks the year zero of Tamrielic callendar. Since that time many rulers tried to repeat his enormous achivement."

 form_edominion_desc:0 "Despite the huge differences between the meretic races the tradition passed down from elf to elf says that they will find aldmeris, their ancient home only if they will unite all elven tribes under one banner.

 form_auridon:0 "Form the Kinlordship of Moridunon"

 form_niben:0 "Form the Kingdom of Nibenay"
 form_niben_desc:0 "Nibenay is the heart and soul of Cyrodiil. The landscape forces the population to rely on trade more than the local production.

 form_cyronordic:0 "Form the Cyro-Nordic Kingdom"
 form_cyronordic_desc:0 "In contrast to the devided elven communities the nords quickly established unified state and their military conquests only enlarged their apetite for more.

 craglorn_must_not_exist:0 "Kingdom of Craglorn must not exist."
 form_craglorn:0 "Form the Kingdom of Craglorn"

 form_hkhamerfell:0 "Form the Kingdom of Deathlands"
 form_hkhamerfell_desc:0 "Areas of deathlands may not look inviting at first but they have always been home to all maner of outcasts from more civilised areas. Greenskins, Elves and Ket-Keptu call this desert enviroment home. Mountain ranges on one side with sea and Iliac bay on the other provide safety from outside dangers. Thanks to this the Deathlands are the only region relatively free from elven influences throuthout merethic era."
 hkhighrock_must_not_exist:0 "Kingdom of High Rock must not exist."
 form_hkhighrock:0 "Form the Kingdom of High Rock"
 form_hkhighrock_desc:0 "High Rock is a refuge to many who faced prosecutions or war. Its mountains and hills prevented it from being dominated by oone force.

 form_dcovenant:0 "Form the Daggerfall Covenant"
 form_dcovenant_desc:0 "For milenia the races of orcs, men and elves fought endless conflicts over the wild lands of north-western Tamriel not seing the bigger picture.

 form_anequina:0 "Form the Kingdom of Anequina"
 form_anequina_desc:0 "The northern clans of Elsweyr always looked with distaste on their southern cusins believing them to be decadent.

 palatine_must_not_exist:0 "Kingdom of Pellitine must not exist."
 form_palatine:0 "Form the Kingdom of Pellitine"
 form_palatine_desc:0 "The southern clans of Elsweyr prefer to deal with their enemies in diplomatic way and are generally richer than their northern cusins due to proximity of lucrative trade routes.

 hkelsweyr_must_not_exist:0 "Kingdom of Elsweyr must not exist."
 form_hkelsweyr:0 "Form the Kingdom of Elsweyr"
 form_hkelsweyr_desc:0 "The Khajiit are a clan based society. Thats why it is very hard task for them to form united front. In the past the dominant kingdom changed like the phases of the moons that big cats worship. Many think that uniting the catfolk is an impossible task. Thou it didn't stopped anyone from trying. As they say the perfect society is always elswhere. Khajiit do not have to be perfect but they should beunited. "
 emoonempire_must_not_exist:0 "Moon Empire must not exist."
 form_emoonempire:0 "Form the Moon Empire"
 form_emoonempire_desc:0 "Today Moon Empire is believed by the most Khajiit to be myth or in best scenario nationalistic idea. The scholar that studies the topic soon finds out that is not the case. The walls of Dune or a famous Moon Gates are clear material evidence of existance of the Khajiiti Empire but the question remains. Why it fell? Why we have so little sources from the period? And more important can it be reformed?"

 form_westskyrim:0 "Form the Kingdom of West Skyrim"
 form_westskyrim_desc:0 "Due to the existance of many trade routes like Pale Pass western Skyrim is way more open and cosmopolitan than its eastern counterparts.

This is one of the reasons why before the house of Ysgramor the administrative center of realm was here."
 hkskyrim_must_not_exist:0 "Kingdom of Skyrim must not exist."
 form_hkskyrim:0 "Form the Kingdom of Skyrim"
 form_hkskyrim_desc:0 "Skyrim or how the elves call it Mereth is separated from other provinces by large mountain chains that create natural fortress. Additionally the area of a province itself is also devided by smaller hills and mountains which makes ruling the area hard.

 form_reach:0 "Form the Kingdom of Reach"
 form_reach_desc:0 "Reachmen tales suggest them being related to the druids of High Rock but the nordic and elven recods claim them being the original inhabitants of the region. The mountains and valleys make from the Reach a natural place to hide so it is not surprising that all maner of daedric cults have deep roots here. The reachmen themselves are very independent minded and rarely follow one leader. The new ruler will have a tough task uniting various clans."

 form_empireofman:0 "Form the Empire of Tamriel"
 form_empireofman_desc:0 "The ancient prophecy says that one day a warrior will come.

 form_nordicempire:0 "Form the Nordic Empire"
 form_nordicempire_desc:0 "After arriving in Tamriel the Nords saw that most of local humans are directly or indirectly subordinated to the elves.

At first this manifested in sponsoring the human urisings in northern Cyrodiil but later seeing how week the elven realms really are many Jarls started to speak about expansion outside of Skyrim."

 form_solstheim:0 "Form the Kingdom of Solstheim"
 form_solstheim_desc:0 "Solstheim is a sizable island on the edge of a continent. It's distant location protects it's inhabitants from the influence from Tamriel that's why it's one of the fiew places where the original atmoran beliefs survived to this day. Uniting the races of Solstheim can help to protect the island unique culture. Also it's perfect staging ground for the invasion of a mainland."
 hkresdayn_must_not_exist:0 "Kingdom of Resdayn must not exist."
 form_hkresdayn:0 "Form the Kingdom of Resdayn"
 form_hkresdayn_desc:0 "For ages the east have been the battleground between chimer and dwemer. The religious conflict was very costly for both sides and the recent threat from the human ascension is something that for the first time can unite the Readayani elves against common enemy. We need a Hortator to push back the incoming wave!"

 form_hkargonia:0 "Form the Kingdom of Argonia"
 form_hkargonia_desc:0 "Argonia is sometimes more commonly known as Black Marsh. The province as the name suggest is generally covered in impenetrable marshes. The interior of the Area is so toxic that outsiders can live there only by using special helmets with filters. This area may seem imhospitable but it's the perfect land wfor those willing to disappear from the world. It's home not only for argonians but also for local breed of humans and Barsebic elves escaping their daedra worshipping brethren in the west. Every one of them dreams of one day uniting the region and making it a safe base for conquest of Tamriel."
 eargonia_must_not_exist:0 "Empire of Argonia must not exist."
 form_eargonia:0 "Form the Empire of Argonia"
 form_eargonia_desc:0 "It's really hard to define where borders trully lay. It's not because of politics at all it's just that marshlands of Argonia span all the way from the niben river up to the foothills of Valus Mountains and encompass almost quater of Resdayn. Generally if you got warning shot from argonian archer that means you deffinately went too far."
 evelothi_must_not_exist:0 "Velothi Empire must not exist."
 form_evelothi:0 "Form the Velothi Empire"
 form_evelothi_desc:0 "Chimer always wanted to control Argonia. For this endavor they modified their armour so that it's able to protect them from the hard conditions of the area. Most of Chimer economy is dependant on slaves and argonians are simply the easiest one to obtain. With the Black marsh under control eastern elves could start dreaming about Dominating the rest of Tamriel."

 form_hkseasload:0 "Form the Kingdom of Sea Sloads"
 form_hkseasload_desc:0 "There are two kinds of Sloads. The Thrassians and Sea Sloads. The first are less common sight in the coasts of Tamriel but the latter come from the sloads that were expelled from Alinor in the beginning of Merethic Era. Sloads are very calculative creatures so they do not believe in revenge thats why constant attempts at reconquering their lost lands are so strange."
 dwemerempire_must_not_exist:0 "Empire of Dwemer must not exist."
 form_dwemerempire:0 "Form the Empire of Dwemer"
 form_dwemerempire_desc:0 "There were two attempts at uniting the Dwemer nation under one banner. Due largely to the clan based society of the deep elves themselves the best what dwemer managed to achieve was formation of House Dwemer and only because of threat posed by migrating Chimer. With a wise leader deep elves could create a powerfull empire and without internal issues they could finally focus on worshipping Nirni by uncovering her secrets. "
 hortatorate_must_not_exist:0 "Hortatorate must not exist."
 form_hortatorate:0 "Form Hortatorate"
 form_hortatorate_desc:0 "Hortator is an old title from the times when Chimer were still purely nomadic society. Today Great House system is prevelant within chimer society but still when something threatens the chimer Houses gather to choose a leader that will carry them throu the crisis. Talented individual could use this to unite the nation permanently."
