 form_hkelsweyr:0 "Form the Kingdom of Elsweyr"
 form_hkelsweyr_desc:0 "The Khajiit are a clan based society. Thats why it is very hard task for them to form united front.

 form_emoonempire:0 "Form the Moon Empire"
 form_emoonempire_desc:0 "Today Moon Empire is believed by the most Khajiit to be myth or in best scenario nationalistic idea. The scholar that studies the topic soon finds out that is not the case.

 form_eargonia:0 "Form the Empire of Argonia"
 form_eargonia_desc:0 "It's really hard to define where borders trully lay. It's not because of politics at all it's just that marshlands of Argonia span all the way from the niben river up to the foothills of Valus Mountains and encompass almost quater of Resdayn. Generally if you got warning shot from argonian archer that means you deffinately went too far."

 form_dwemerempire:0 "Form the Empire of Dwemer"
 form_dwemerempire_desc:0 "There were two attempts at uniting the Dwemer nation under one banner. Due largely to the clan based society of the deep elves themselves the best what dwemer managed to achieve was formation of House Dwemer and only because of threat posed by migrating Chimer.
