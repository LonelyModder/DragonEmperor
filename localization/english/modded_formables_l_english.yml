Historically, the Altmers have made them the second richest and most populous area in Tamriel after Cyrodiil. Even Tiber Septim decided to fight the Altmers only after obtaining the Numidium, Weapon of Mass Destruction, from the Morrowinds living gods."

 form_orsinium_desc:0 "Orsinium was a great dream of the greenskin races of Tamriel. Both the orcs and goblins dreamed of a place where their race could live far from hostile races and where they could cultivate their customs in peace.
