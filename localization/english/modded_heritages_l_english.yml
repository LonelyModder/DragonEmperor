 altmer_heritage:0 "Altmer Heritage"
 altmer_heritage_desc:0 "The Altmers are reputed to be the oldest and most advanced Elvish civilization on Tamriel. Most likely, in the case of the first statement it is not true, but because their homeland is a natural fortress, they could focus on internal development without the need for constant rivalry and wars. Not to mention the occasional attacks by the Sloads and Moarmers that forced the development of the navy."

 ayleid_heritage_desc:0 "The Ayleids, or cousins of the Altmers from the center of the continent, had to contend with intense human expansion in the region. Their technological superiority and the use of Daedra led them to enslave the Nedas, and by exploiting their potential of cheap labor, they created a large but decentralized empire."
 nede_heritage:0 "Nedic Heritage"
 nede_heritage_desc:0 "Descendants of the first wave of migrants from Atmora, a continent in the north. Divided into many tribes, they inhabit almost every corner of Tamriel. Their internal divisions often made them victims of more advanced races."
 goblin_heritage:0 "Goblin Heritage"
 goblin_heritage_desc:0 "Goblins are almost everywhere, their appearance makes them suspected of being related to the orcs, which is not true as they are older than them. However, the appearance of the similarity does not end there. Most of the goblins worship Malacath by calling him the blue god or Muluk."
 bosmer_heritage:0 "Bosmer Heritage"
 bosmer_heritage_desc:0 "Centuries ago the Bosmerians made a so-called green pact with the nature deity Y'ephre. One of the conditions is respect for plants. They cannot be eaten, cut, etc. Therefore, forest elves, among others, they eat the dead, e.g. defeated enemies. The building blocks of their cities have to be imported or houses are formed from trees without destroying them."
