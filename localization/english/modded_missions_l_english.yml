 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_DESCRIPTION:0 "Centuries ago since the Ayleid elves colonized the Niben Valley local humans were treated at best as second class citizens. The situation of nedes (humans from Tamriel) worsen dramatically after most of their elven masters accept the cult of daedra in their lands. They started to perform dark rituals with the use of human sacrifices to their dark dieties. Luckly the worship of daedric lords also caused the civil war within the Ayleid Empire and this created an opportunity for a couple of nedic leaders to revolt against their ayleid opressors."

 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_1:0 "In the Hour of Need"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_1_DESC:2 "The nedic revolt was largely caused by the evil practices of their elven overlords, yet the nedes were still afraid of the wrath of their masters and decided to put their case in front of the gods to ensure their favor."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_2:0 "Aid from the North"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_2_DESC:2 "How some scholar long ago said the successful revolution need three things to succeed: reason for dissatisfaction, visible reaction for said reason and finally someone who will finance the said revolt. Thats why the nedes consider sending messengers to Skyrim to negotiate support with the High King. "
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_3:0 "New Battle Tactics"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_3_DESC:2 "The vast jungles and forests of Cyrodiil are a very difficult terrain that is hard to control. The reble forces used it with great success put there always comes time when you need to face your enemy in open field. Thats why the idea of employing ayleid prisoners of war and nordic warriors to create new army in exchange for their freedom."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_4:0 "Rising in Revolt"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_4_DESC:2 "The hardest thing in the revolt is going from attacking the countryside to capturing the cities. That is precisely the point when your enemies start to notice you and the only road ahead is to win or die trying."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_5:0 "Dread Castellan"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_5_DESC:2 "Unaril is the stronget champion the Ayleid empire ever had. His control over the heart of Cyrodiil gives him vast army and very defensible position. With his skills as a sorcerer the direct attack seems suicidal but Pelinal claims that he can defeat him. This may be the mission from which he will not return but then is his life worth it. He is the best nedic general we have."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_6:0 "First Capital"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_6_DESC:2 "The growing rebelion needs bigger headquaters. The obvious choice is the hill fortress of Tor in north-west which is close to our allies and also a very remote and defensible location. From there planning the next offensives will be way easier."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_7:0 "Nords in Bruma"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_7_DESC:2 "Our scouts in Pale Pass brought the troubling news. Large group of nords crossed the pass and heads south. Beside the group of warriors there are also wemen and children in the group so they probably intend to settle in. Maybe we will be able to convince them to join our cause?"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_8:0 "Nords in Cheydinhal"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_8_DESC:2 "Our scouts in Jerall Mountains brought the troubling news. Large group of nords crossed the pass and heads south. Beside the group of warriors there are also wemen and children in the group so they probably intend to settle in. Maybe we will be able to convince them to join our cause?"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_9:0 "Founding Bravil"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_9_DESC:2 "Recently our very talented young officer returned from the front lines with intresting idea. During particularly difficult siege of Anutwyll he saw a perfect location for a new outpost. An isle to the south of the coty he was besieging. This new fortress could help us in cotroling the Niben and trade routes leading south."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_10:0 "Conditional Surrneder"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_10_DESC:2 "The Ayleid kings of Colovia contrary to their heartlander counterparts were primarily merchants and didn't participated in the cruel practices of their kinsmen. Many of them kept the faith in Auri-El and their subjects remaind loyal to them. Thats why some Colovians within our ranks proposed to allow them to surrender piecefully and join our cause to atone for the sins of their race."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_11:0 "Delegation to Valenwood"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_11_DESC:2 "Eplear Camoran's unification of the Bosmer marks the beginig of time in calendars of most nations on Tamriel. This is no small achivement. Camorans are the first to unite their race under one state. Since the first year of the first age all bosmer live and die under their rule. This forced even the anti-elven nedic rebels to try the diplomacy to deal with border issue. Camorans are known from non-violent approach when dealing with foreign ambasadors so maybe then whole thing will end peacefully."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_12:0 "Cyrodiilic Empire"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_12_DESC:2 "For the first time since the Ayleids first spet foot on the lands of Cyrodiil the nedes are truly free from elven influence. From Jerall Mountains to Topal Bay almost all elven strongholds surrendered to our rule. Never again elven king will be ruling over man of Cyrod."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_13:0 "Al-Esh"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_13_DESC:2 "Al-Esh, more commonly known as Alessia, is the leader of our movement. Lately she was captured by the enemy who didn't knew her true importance. She needs to be rescued from captivity before the elven opressors manage to break her."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_14:0 "House Tharn Defection"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_14_DESC:2 "House Tharn is well known from their collaboration with the Ayleid elves. They earned their fortune by hunting slaves for the king of Fanacas. Now we learned that one of them contacted us and want to aid our cause in exchange for his families wealth and contacts in the Ayleid Empire. This may really hurt the elves, but can they be trusted after all they have done."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_15:0 "Uniting the Tribes"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_15_DESC:2 "Thou our group is the biggest in the empire we are not the only one. There are numerous nedic tribes in ayleid realm that achived independence in this chaotic times. Alessia believes that the best course of action is to convince them that only together we can chase the daedra worshippers out of Cyrodiil."
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_16:0 "Capture of White-Gold Tower"
 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_16_DESC:2 "For centuries White-Gold Tower was a symbol of Ayleid power and domination over men. Today we managed to capture the city but the nedic rebels demand the retribution for all the crimes the elves commited while our elven supporters beg for restraint and protection for their most holy site. This on the other hand may anger the soldiers that expect plunder for their service."

 unificationwars_01_skyrim_1:0 "The Boy King"
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_1_DESC:2 "The high king is dead and the new one is still barely a child. Half of the realm does not recognize the authority of queen regentand her council. Yet still the new leaders of a fractured realm need to prepare the coronation of a new leader King Harald."
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_2:0 "Battleborn and Greymane"
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_2_DESC:2 "To everyones surprise at the coronation there were two clan leaders from Whiterun present. The Battleborn and Greymanes known from their ties to the original 500 companions of Ysgramor. In fact their families helped to found the Whiterun back in day. Maybe they can bring the Whiterun back into the fold, after all why send warriors when a little bribe will do."
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_3:0 "The Pale"
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_3_DESC:2 "Dawnstar is pretty remote location yet the warriors of the pale are said to be one of the strongest in the realm. Ruled by the clan Begalin the people of Downstar keep the old traditions alive including the traditional duels. This can be used against them but if we loose we may also loose the claim to the throne in the eyes of people of skyrim."
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_4:0 "Marshes of Hjaalmarch"
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_4_DESC:2 "Hjaalmarch is pretty remote place and almost entire region is covered with marshes. Morthal the capital of the region is basically a larger village and most of other jarls does not recognize it's leaders status. Probably that was the main reason for their secession. Morthal is also home to the community of mages and we cannot let them live outside of our jurisdiction."
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_5:0 "Solitude"
 unificationwars_01_skyrim_5_DESC:2 "Solitude using it's natural advantages is a very good defensive location and a perfect place for a harbour all in one. Thats why it's the biggest harbour in the western Skyrim. Everyone who wants to control this region needs the city for both strategic reasons and economic ones. Recapturing the city will once and for all end the revolt."
