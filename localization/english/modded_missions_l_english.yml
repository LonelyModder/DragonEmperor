 alessianempire_01_alessianrevolt_DESCRIPTION:0 "Centuries ago since the Ayleid elves colonized the Niben Valley local humans were treated at best as second class citizens. The situation of nedes (humans from Tamriel) worsen dramatically after most of their elven masters accept the cult of daedra in their lands. They started to perform dark rituals with the use of human sacrifices to their dark dieties. Luckly the worship of daedric lords also caused the civil war within the Ayleid Empire and this created an opportunity for a couple of nedic leaders to revolt against their ayleid opressors."
