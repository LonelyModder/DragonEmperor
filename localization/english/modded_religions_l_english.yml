 desc_elven_pantheon:0 "The early faith of the elves was centered on the worship of ancestors, which over time turned into the cult of the most powerful of them, such as Trinimac, Syrabane, and Phynaster. The cult of Magnus, the creator of the plans of the mortal world, was also strong. However, nothing compares to the worship of Auri-El, the sun god victor over the fraud god Lorkhan and the creator of the first elven kingdom."
