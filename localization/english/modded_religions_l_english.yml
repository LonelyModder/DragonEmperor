 #Modded Religions
 elven_pantheon:0 "Anuic"
 desc_elven_pantheon:0 "The early faith of the elves was centered on the worship of ancestors, which over time turned into the cult of the most powerful of them, such as Trinimac, Syrabane, and Phynaster. The cult of Magnus, the creator of the plans of the mortal world, was also strong. However, nothing compares to the worship of Auri-El, the sun god victor over the fraud god Lorkhan and the creator of the first elven kingdom."
 oldelven_pantheon:0 "Psijic"
 desc_oldelven_pantheon:0 "In the meretic era, the sect of mages broke away from the high elves on religious grounds. They considered it heresy to abandon the worship of their ancestors in favor of the worship of a select few who had attained divinity."
 nedic_pantheon:0 "Shezzaric"
 desc_nedic_pantheon:0 "Nedic beliefs differ from tribe to tribe. They are known to worship both Aedra and Daedra but the deity with the most followers is definitely the Shezzar (beter known under the name Lorkhan). Some rituals require human sacrifice. It is also known that some strains have contacts with the Hargravens sect."
 goblin_pantheon:0 "Goblin"
 desc_goblin_pantheon:0 "We don't have much detail about the goblins' faith, but the fact is that they mostly worship Malacatha. Some of them also have objects related to the cult of Hircine, so it can be concluded that they mainly worship Daedra."
 green_pantheon:0 "Green Pact"
 desc_green_pantheon:0 "Wood elves have quite radical beliefs. According to a pact with the nature deity Y'ephre, they were not allowed to eat or harm plants, so they developed the habit of cannibalism and usually wear leather clothes. The building material of their homes is imported from outside the Valenwood forest."
 deadric_pantheon:0 "Daedric"
 desc_deadric_pantheon:0 "The Daedric Lords are those et'Ada who did not take part in the creation of the mortal world but created domains out of themselves in Oblivion (sphere of existance closest to the mortal plane). There are also accounts of other et'Ada becoming Daedric Princes after the creation of Mundus like for example Meridia, which also involves the creation of their own realms of Oblivion."
 codeofmalacath_pantheon:0 "Code of Malacath"
 desc_codeofmalacath_pantheon:0 "Set of rules that followers of Malacath, must abide to like do not steal, do not kill, do not attack without reason, fight with honor, protect your tribe.

 khajiiti_pantheon:0 "Khajiiti"
 desc_khajiiti_pantheon:0 "The belief of the Khajiit is in a sense a combination of the deities of the neighboring races with a particular emphasis on the planet's moons, which are important in the breeding process of the catmen. The shape an adult khajiit will take literally depends on Messer and Secundas phase."
 hist_pantheon:0 "Hist"
 desc_hist_pantheon:0 "Hist trees may look like mere pieces of wood, but they are actually a fully sentient species, most likely from the oblivion dimension. In addition to the Hists, the Argonians worship Sithis, a remnant of their ancient beliefs from before the mysterious religious reform."
 nordic_pantheon:0 "Nordic"
 desc_nordic_pantheon:0 "Nords divide the history of the world into cycles, therefore their gods are divided into three groups. Dead ones like Shor who sacrificed themselves to start the current cycle. Gods taking caro of the current cycle like Kyne (she is especially revered) and gods who will end the cycle like Alduin."
 imperial_pantheon:0 "Divines"
 desc_imperial_pantheon:0 "Faith in Eight Devine Aedra was formed to unify elven and human inhabitants of Cyrodiil. The pantheon consists of the gods that both sides recognize as politically correct. For example Shor also known as Shezzar or simply Lorkhan was not included as elves believe that he stole their immortality."
 druidic_pantheon:0 "Druidic"
 desc_druidic_pantheon:0 "Druids follow Y'ffre True Way (later known as Druidism) in which the eponymous god took the forefront of their faith.

They held onto the Oak's Promise, a belief to 'stand strong, stay true, and shelter all'."
 wyrdite_pantheon:0 "Wyrdite"
 desc_wyrdite_pantheon:0 "Wyrd and the Druids share common root but at some point they were devided by ideological differences. The druids believe that civilisation can coexist with nature while wyrd views them as nearly as bad as city-dwellers. The wyrd in oposition to druidism is very anti elven as one of the reasons for the schism were the 'excesses of the elves'. "
 nirnic_pantheon:0 "Nirnist"
 desc_nirnic_pantheon:0 "The religion of the Deep Elves is a very complex topic. They refuse to worship the gods or the daedra cause they believe them to be mere mortals that got the godly powers. They believe that only Nirni the world as a whole is worthy of worship and as such the believers are morally obliged to study the world and uncover all it's secrets."
 night_pantheon:0 "Night Cults"
 desc_night_pantheon:0 "It is common misconception that vampires and werewolfs worship Molag Bal and Hercine exclusively. When you are one of the most wanted beings on Tamriel any new ally is precious. Thats why you can see vampires worshiping Clavicus Vile or Nocturnal. There exists even prominent cult of Sanguine among vampires from Elsweyr."
 idealmasters_pantheon:0 "Ideal Masters"
 desc_idealmasters_pantheon:0 "Every necromancer that lived long enaugh becomes aware of the existance of the Ideal Masters.

 reachmen_pantheon:0 "Old Gods"
 desc_reachmen_pantheon:0 "Reachmen worship ancestors, some lesser spirits and more powerfull greater spirits. Contrary to popular belief they do not worship daedra in a sense like elves worship their dieties. They have more give and take relationship with them. They can make a deal with daedric lord if this will benefit their tribe. Some of their practices are simillar to the druidic."
 allmaker_pantheon:0 "All-Maker"
 desc_allmaker_pantheon:0 "A unique branch of nordic faith found only in the Skaal tribe from Solstheim. The Skaal believe not in pantheon but in one god called All-Maker (or All-Father) and claim that all life comes from him like a river. In oposition to him exists a diety called Adversary. The two share many similarities with tale of Anu and Padomay known from elven myths."
 dragoncult_pantheon:0 "Dragon Cult"
 desc_dragoncult_pantheon:0 "Dragons are immortal beings. Even after their bodies are destroyed their souls can be reimbodied by another dragon. At first they lived in the Akavir but after they were chased away by Tsaesci they found refuge with the nords of Atmora. When the Dragon Cult became tyranic, nords overthrew the dragons in famous revolt. The dragons or dovah as they call themselves feel natural need for domination and when in power are worshipped as gods."
 velothi_pantheon:0 "Velothi"
 desc_velothi_pantheon:0 "The last splinter group of the Aldmer left Alinor because of religious prosecutions. They refused to abandon the faith in their daedric dieties and decided to move as far away from their opressors as it is phisically possible.

 satakalite_pantheon:0 "Satakalite"
 desc_satakalite_pantheon:0 "The Sea Elves believe in a number of gods but the most surprising at least for the inhabitants of Tamriel is the worship of Satakal, the diety normally connected with yokudans that are very hostile to the elves. It might be partially explained by the giant sea serpents being important part of everyday life of the Moarmer. Also Sea Elves are frequently seen praying to the Mother Sea and also Hermeus Mora have a large number of worshippers on Pyandonea."
 sithis_pantheon:0 "Cult of Sithis"
 desc_sithis_pantheon:0 "Sithis is not a god. He's way more than a god. Sithis is primal force of nature representing void, emptiness and destruction. From followers Sithis demands blood sacrifices. The more terrified the victim, the more pleasing the sacrifice is in the eyes of the Dread Father. Before the appearence of the Hist argonians worshipped Sithis as their protective diety but now only tribes in far away Pyandonea do so officially."
 yokudan_pantheon:0 "Yokudan"
 desc_yokudan_pantheon:0 "At first Yokudan pantheon seems different than the Tamrielic one because for example Anu and Padomay were connected into one diety called Satakal. Yet we can also recognize well known dieties like Tava, for tamrielians known as Kynareth or Sep, who is Yokudan version of Lorkhan. The faith is very war oriented as is generally yokudan culture. "
 nordicanimism_pantheon:0 "Atmoran"
 desc_nordicanimism_pantheon:0 "Atmoran pantheon is a primitive version of nordic pantheon with similar gods in form of animistic representation. For example Shor is represented as Fox and Tsun is worshipped in form of a Bear. In skyrim religion changed under the influence of nedes and mer but in regions as Roscrea the old beliefs survived."
 slavic_pantheon:0 "Heresy"
