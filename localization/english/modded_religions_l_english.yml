 #Modded Religions
 elven_pantheon:0 "Elven"
 desc_elven_pantheon:0 "The early faith of the elves was centered on the worship of ancestors, which over time turned into the cult of the most powerful of them, such as Trinimac, Syrabane, and Phynaster. The cult of Magnus, the creator of the plans of the mortal world, was also strong. However, nothing compares to the worship of Auri-El, the sun god victor over the fraud god Lorkhan and the creator of the first elven kingdom."
 oldelven_pantheon:0 "Old Elven"
 desc_oldelven_pantheon:0 "In the meretic era, the sect of mages broke away from the high elves on religious grounds. They considered it heresy to abandon the worship of their ancestors in favor of the worship of a select few who had attained divinity."
 nedic_pantheon:0 "Nedic"
 desc_nedic_pantheon:0 "Nedic beliefs differ from tribe to tribe. They are known to worship both Aedra and Daedra. Some rituals require human sacrifice. It is also known that some strains have contacts with the Hargravens sect."
 goblin_pantheon:0 "Goblin"
 desc_goblin_pantheon:0 "We don't have much detail about the goblins' faith, but the fact is that they mostly worship Malacatha. Some of them also have objects related to the cult of Hircine, so it can be concluded that they mainly worship Daedra."
 green_pantheon:0 "Green Pact"
 desc_green_pantheon:0 "Wood elves have quite radical beliefs. According to a pact with the nature deity Y'ephre, they were not allowed to eat or harm plants, so they developed the habit of cannibalism and usually wear leather clothes. The building material of their homes is imported from outside the Valenwood forest."
 ayleid_pantheon:0 "Ayleid"
 desc_ayleid_pantheon:0 "In addition to believing in traditional elven deities, wild elves usually worshiped one of the daedra. In return, they bestowed the elves with deadric hordes. The cult of Meridia was by far the most popular. Ayleid warriors styled their armors after the Aurorans (Meridias Daedric wariors)."
 deadric_pantheon:0 "Deadric"
 desc_deadric_pantheon:0 "The Daedric Lords are those et'Ada who did not take part in the creation of the mortal world but created domains out of themselves in Oblivion (sphere of existance closest to the mortal plane). There are also accounts of other et'Ada becoming Daedric Princes after the creation of Mundus like for example Meridia, which also involves the creation of their own realms of Oblivion."
 slavic_pantheon:0 "Heresy"
