 omen_oneness:1 "Oneness with the Land"
 omen_oneness_desc:4 "Skaal practice this concept by seeking harmony with their surroundings. For example, firewood is collected from dead trees. Hunting is for subsistence, not sport. The sanctity of life demands that violence only be used as a last resort. When harmony is upset the All-Maker blessings abandon the believers."
 deity_circleoflife:0 "$omen_circleoflife$"
 omen_circleoflife:1 "Circle of Life"
 omen_circleoflife_desc:4 "All life flows from the All-Maker like a great river, and, in time, this river flows back to its source. The spirits of dead creatures return to the All-Maker, who shapes new life and returns it to Mundus. Death, then, is simply the beginning of the next stage of this endless journey."
 deity_allmaker:0 "$omen_allmaker$"
 omen_allmaker:1 "All-Maker"
 omen_allmaker_desc:4 "Revered as the wellspring of creation. It is reported that All-Maker indeed gives powers to his followers if they obey his laws. You can gain his favor by participation in ritual hunt Ristaag or by holy pilgrimage to the stones dedicated to All-Maker and in the process restoration of the oneness in the land."
 deity_wrathofallmaker:0 "$omen_wrathofallmaker$"
 omen_wrathofallmaker:1 "Wrath of Nature"
 omen_wrathofallmaker_desc:4 "All-Maker may look like a pieceful diety at first but because of being in part god of nature he can have great influence on well being of his believers and enemies. Acording to one of the legends he is responsible for creation of spriggans. Skaal are know to fight alongside the bears and wolfs when at war which is probably connected to the blessing of All-Maker."
