 modded_axemen_desc:0 "Axemen are mainly used by humans and wilder tribes of beastmen. Perfect against phalanx spearmen."
 modded_archers_desc:0 "Archers, Crossbowmen, and other ranged units. They are perfect for first contact and reconnaissance units."
 modded_swordsmen_desc:0 "Hardly anyone can afford a sword because its forging requires decent ore and a lot of time. It is a weapon of the more civilized factions."
 modded_spearmen_desc:0 "The standard unit of that period, forming the backbone of most of the army. A punch does not require that much material and it is easy to train a person to use it."
 modded_griphons_desc:0 "Almers have always looked at these animals with genuine admiration and fascination. Their domestication was very difficult and actually succeeded by pure coincidence, when an egg flew into the fire during noisy dances during a feast. Griphon eggs are a famous delicacy."
 modded_mages_desc:0 "Training a magician takes a lot of time and resources, so it's no wonder that elves who have an innate magic talent excel in the field of magic."
 modded_cavalry_desc:0 "Maintaining a mount is expensive and requires pasture, so few can afford these units. However, their presence on the battlefield decides the fate of the battles."
 modded_horse_archers_desc:0 "Mounted archer units are mainly used by the nations of Akavir, where are conditions for breeding steppe horses. Tsaesci are famous for using them."
 modded_camels_desc:0 "The smell of camels has a deterrent effect on the mounts, which was used during many battles. Additionally, these animals are very durable and perfect for desert fights."
 modded_deadra_desc:0 "Demons, mainly ordinary dremors, but also atronachs and other monsters summoned by mages with the consent of the Princes of Oblivion."
 modded_beasts_desc:0 "Some races like Bosmers can order animals like bears and wolves to fight for them. In extreme cases, they can even change into them."
